In this exercise, you will add a Databricks Notebook activity to your ADF pipeline which will run the [Databricks-Data-Transformations.dbc]($./includes/Databricks-Data-Transformations) notebook, located in the `/includes` directory of the lab files you uploaded to your Databricks workspace.\n\nTake a few minutes to review the contents of this notebook to understand what transformations are being applied to the datasets being ingested into your Blob storage account via ADF. Also, notice that the notebook defines widgets named `accountKey`, `accountName`, and `containerName`. You will be passing these values in as parameters from ADF so the notebook can connect to your Azure Storage account.\n\n![ADF Widgets](https://databricksdemostore.blob.core.windows.net/images/03/03/adf-widgets.png \"ADF Widgets\")\n\nTo modify your pipeline, return to the ADF UI in a web browser and select the Author (pencil) icon in the left-hand menu, and then select your pipeline under Pipelines.\n\n![ADF UI Author blade](https://databricksdemostore.blob.core.windows.net/images/03/03/adf-author-blade.png \"ADF UI Author blade\")\n\nOnce there, expand Databricks under Activities, then drag the Notebook activity onto the design surface, and drop it to the right of the existing copy activity.\n\n![Add Databricks Notebook activity](https://databricksdemostore.blob.core.windows.net/images/03/03/adf-add-activity-databricks-notebook.png \"Add Databricks Notebook activity\")\n\nSelect the Notebook activity on the design surface to display tabs containing its properties and settings at the bottom of the screen, then enter the following:\n\n### General tab\n\n1.
